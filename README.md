Technologies I used:
* React,
* React-router-dom,
* Hooks,
* React redux,
* firebase,
* semantic ui react,
* uuid,
* moment,
* mime-types,
* create-react-app,
* JavaScript (ES6+),
* Git 

Slack-like app. Possibility to register a member. We can create a channel, add to favourites, and send private messages to register members. Possibility to send messages in jpg. All of this is stocked in firebase. Ui semnatic is responsible for styling and state management is written in react-redux.
